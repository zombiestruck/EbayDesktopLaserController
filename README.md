# EbayDesktopLaserController
I was fed up with the limited controls available with a Chinese 3000mw laser engraver's software. I purchased it through eBay and decided to decompile the program and adjust it to my liking. This is a WIP.

The source is the generic software used by most ebay laser engravers. I just wanted to be able to customize it.
